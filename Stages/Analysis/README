The Analysis stage is the first stage that takes place when LLVM hands off
control to CLIPS. It is tasked with:

1) Identifying Parent Hierarchies for BasicBlocks, Regions, Instructions, and
Loops
2) Identifying Variant and Invariant Operands for Instructions and BasicBlocks
3) Identifying Producers and Consumers on the Block Level
4) Partial Aspect Block Choking using the list of UsedInBlocks found in each
instruction.

What's neat about this stage is that the rules can be fired in any order as
they will evaluate correctly based on salience tweaking and the fact that the
information is independent of one another. This means that I don't need to
worry about breaking pre-existing rules as I add new rules to this Stage.

This stage will contain the most number of rules out of any stage

As this code is being written this list will be updated.
