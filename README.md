This is one half of my masters thesis. The objective of which was to apply
wavefront scheduling to superscalar processors. The other aspect required is
LibExpertSystem. I have kept them separate because they are technically
standalone.

However, this code will NOT work in a standard clips build. There are functions
defined in LibExpertSystem that this implementation requires. 

Whoever you are, I hope you enjoy perusing through this code. It was a lot of
fun to write. 

The only requirement I have is that you MUST use clips 630 beta or higher. I
use the foreach statement in several parts (11th hour change....) which was
introduced in 630.
